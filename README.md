*This protoype depicts features of a possible mobile app to support people during their transition into retirement. It was designed in the course of my master thesis "Modeling and designing features of a mobile application for healthy aging while transitioning into retirement" and used especially for qualitative research interviews with potential end users.* 

## Abstract of the thesis 
### Background and Motivation
With demographic shifts, nearly half of the healthcare expenses nowadays go to the growing retiree population. As a result, promoting healthy aging and active lifestyles has become a priority globally. The transition to retirement presents both opportunities and challenges, potentially impacting well-being in positive and also negative ways. Digital interventions, particularly mobile health (mHealth) apps, offer accessible support by leveraging mobile technology. The thesis focused on enhancing such interventions through personalization based on users' emotions and preferences, with the potential integration of AI for a more tailored experience.

### Methods
The thesis aimed to design and model features for a mobile app supporting people in their transition to retirement. A comprehensive literature review and state-of-the-art research informed the theoretical and technical foundations. With a user-centered design (UCD) process, I developed and refined app features through a two-iteration approach. First, an online survey gathered user insights, leading to an initial feature draft visualized in a mockup prototype. Interviews with potential end-users provided qualitative feedback, which shaped a refined, interactive prototype. The second round of testing focused on usability and personalization, ensuring the features were both effective and user-accepted.

### Results
Five categories with different features to support well-being while transitioning into retirement were found and presented to four potential end-users in the design process. Personalization is included in all categories, especially with two AI-powered chatbots that make tailored interactions for the users available. Those sparked great interest but also security concerns from the design process participants, with strong potential interest, especially if endorsed by health experts. Overall, the evaluation by the participants brought insights about the effects and acceptance and led to a user-friendly feature design.

### Conclusions
This thesis laid the groundwork for a mobile app supporting healthy aging during retirement. With personalized features across multiple well-being dimensions, the design aims to enhance engagement and effectiveness. While AI-powered chatbots showed promise, concerns about data privacy, bias, and ethics require careful implementation. Future research should develop a fully functional prototype, expand user testing, and refine AI for better acceptance. Long-term studies and accessibility will be key to ensuring the appâ€™s success in promoting health and social engagement for retirees.

## Mockup Overview
The mockup and prototype came together in two iterations of design and interveiws. With the link in the first paragrpah you can view the final solution of the interactive prototype. It brought insights into user comprehension, usefulness, usability and design decisions.
